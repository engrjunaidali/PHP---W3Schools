//Declaring Variables

// In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
$txt = "Hello world!";
$x = 5;
$y = 10.5;

// Rules for PHP variables:

//     A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
//     A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
//     A variable name cannot start with a number
//     A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores    (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
//     Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

// Output Variables

$txt = "<br>Pakistan";
echo "I love $txt!";

echo "<br>";

$x = 5;
$y = 4;
echo $x + $y;
